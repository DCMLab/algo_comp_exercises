    "We ask you to compose a a piece from the given materials. You are free in the number of elements you want to be using. For example, if you don't want to work with the audio samples, or only with the audio samples, you may. The only rule is that you cannot add additional material, just transform what you are given. Otherwise, let your creativity go wild!\n",
    "\n",
    "Differently from your semester project that you will work on in the second part of the semester, here we are not asking you to start off with a particular musical idea. Rather, you select musical elements and develop an (algorithmic?) compositional idea from it. So you might probably want to start by exploring the materials and what you can do to them with techniques we have seen in class or others. Communicate with your team members to see what cool ideas and sounds come up and make a plan on how to combine them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing your composition *before* you start hacking it together is a very, very good idea because it can guide you in the process. Naturally, the visualization that you sketch in the beginning does not have to be identical with the one that you hand in at the end. You are free to come up with any form of visualization you find effective in conveying how the materials you choose are organized in time. Also, come up with a description of your composition in one sentence and a title. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't have your creativity constrained by what you already know. Instead, if you have a great idea but don't know how to realize it technically, do your own research and/or post your problem on Piazza so you can get quick advice. \n",
